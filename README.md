# Basic-Modelling-and-Feature-Selection
This exercise utilizes the Ames Boston Housing dataset, for feature selection and modelling. 
As this is a more advanced dataset, it is interesting to see how methods applied to simpler datasets fare here.
Note that this is still a work in progress, with research still ongoing on how to best process it.
